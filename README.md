Model Performance Report
Approach Taken:
Data preprocessing involved handling various column types: categorical (e.g., 'HDB BRANCH NAME', 'FIRST NAME'), date ('APPLICATION LOGIN DATE'), and boolean ('last_name_from_pan'). Date columns were converted to numeric formats, boolean columns to numeric, and categorical columns likely underwent one-hot encoding. Numerical features were scaled. For model selection, a binary classification model (presumably Random Forest) was used to predict 'APPROVED' vs. 'DECLINED'. The model was trained on split data (commonly 80-20 or 70-30) and evaluated using precision, recall, f1-score, and a confusion matrix.

Insights and Conclusions:
The dataset shows imbalance with 66.35% 'APPROVED' and 33.65% 'DECLINED' samples, which impacts model performance. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 83%, with high precision for 'APPROVED' (98%) but lower recall (76%). Conversely, it has high recall for 'DECLINED' (97%) but lower precision (67%). This indicates a conservative approval approach, potentially missing some approvals but catching most declines.

Performance on Validation Data:
Accuracy: 83%. Precision for 'APPROVED': 0.98, 'DECLINED': 0.67. Recall for 'APPROVED': 0.76, 'DECLINED': 0.97. F1-Scores are 0.86 for 'APPROVED' and 0.79 for 'DECLINED'. The confusion matrix shows 1007 true positives, 654 true negatives, 320 false negatives, and 19 false positives.

Recommendations and Next Steps:

Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.
Explore feature engineering and model tuning to improve performance.
Consider threshold adjustments, ensemble methods, and cost-sensitive learning.
Implement regular monitoring and retraining to maintain model efficacy over time.
